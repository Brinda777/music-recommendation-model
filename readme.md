# 🎵 Music Recommendation System  

This project is a **content-based music recommendation system** that suggests similar songs based on audio features like **danceability, energy, and tempo**. It uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for recommendations and integrates with the **Spotify API** to fetch album cover images. The system is served through a **Flask API** and evaluated using **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Song Recommendations**: Suggests similar tracks based on audio features.  
- **Spotify API Integration**: Fetches album cover images for recommended songs.  
- **KNN Model**: Uses Euclidean distance to find similar songs.  
- **Flask API**: Provides recommendations via a RESTful API.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Computes **Mean Average Precision (MAP)** for accuracy.  
- **Postman Testing**: API endpoints can be tested in **Postman**.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Flask** (for the API)  
- **Spotipy** (Spotify API integration)  
- **Postman** (for testing)
